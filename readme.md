# CL86Y Simple Arduino Control

This code achieves simple control of the CL86Y servo controller
I used this controller for the 12Nm Nema 34 servo


## Usage

It uses the serial console to send commands.
- s locks the motor
- st stops the motor
- f sets the forward direction
- b sets the backward direction
- q <steps> <delay> rotates the motor by <steps> with a <delay> between steps
